# React-Costructors-Prototypes


## Constructor and Prototype Practice

In this project, you will work on creating constructors and prototypes
that will help pass a series of pre-written tests.

Starter Files Constructor and Prototype Practice are provided for download.

Inside of the starter_files, you'll find three files.
index.html: A generic HTML file that you will need to get running in the browser
main.js: Where all of your work will happen
tests.js: The testing suite to test your work. You'll want to explore this file, but not edit it.

You'll need to open the HTML file in the browser and open up your browser's JavaScript console.
There will be a series of console statements that you need to make pass in the main.js file. You may not edit the testing functions or the test statements in the tests.js file. It will help to view the tests.js file to take a look at the tests that are running.
You'll be required to write some code in both the Dog and Human constructor as well as create the instances listed with the correct properties.


Use constructors and prototypes to solve each of the test functions, 
as you pass one, a new one will pop up and give you 
the criteria needed to make it pass. 

Once complete, your console should look like the following:
