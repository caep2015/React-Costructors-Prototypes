# React-Costructors-Prototypes


Constructor and Prototype Practice

In this project, you will work on creating constructors and prototypes
that will help pass a series of pre-written tests.

Use constructors and prototypes to solve each of the test functions, 
as you pass one, a new one will pop up and give you 
the criteria needed to make it pass.
